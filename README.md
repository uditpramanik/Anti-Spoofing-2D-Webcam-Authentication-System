# Anti-Spoofing-2D-Webcam-Authentication-System
This repository hosts an innovative and secure Anti-Spoofing 2D Webcam Authentication System designed for enhancing security in digital platforms. The system uniquely integrates facial recognition, liveness detection, and gesture recognition technologies to provide a robust solution against identity spoofing.


Key Features
Real-Time Facial Recognition: Employs cutting-edge techniques for accurate facial identification.
Advanced Liveness Detection: Sophisticated algorithms to differentiate between real persons and photographic or video spoofs.
Gesture Recognition: Leverages MediaPipe for recognizing specific hand gestures as an additional security measure.
User Engagement: Interactive prompts for gesture matching, adding an engaging layer to the authentication process.
Security & Efficiency: Timed sessions and quick response mechanisms ensure both security and user convenience.
Easy to Use and Customize: Designed with a focus on user experience, allowing for easy integration and customization in various applications.
Technologies
The system is built using Python and incorporates a variety of powerful libraries and frameworks:

OpenCV & MTCNN: For image processing and face detection.
MediaPipe: For real-time hand gesture recognition.
TensorFlow & Keras: Powers the facial recognition and liveness detection models.
SciPy & NumPy: Essential for mathematical computations.
